# Project name
## Executive Summary
(overview of project, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Goals
1. Determine optimal programming language
2. Build prototype of BUCS
3. Test prototype of BUCS
4. If an effective countermeasure is created, package for delivery via package handlers like apt, rpm, windows installer, OSX.
5. If found ineffective research what other options there are to develop a product for Windows

These goals are the overall goals of the project. The specifics of how they will be accomplished are to be discussed later in this plan, but our project can be expressed in these four main goals.
