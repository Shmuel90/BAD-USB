# Project name
## Executive Summary
Users need an easy way to input data to a computer. This led to the creation of devices such as mice and keyboards to allow users to achieve that goal. Throughout the years, technology of mice and keyboards alike grew, and we now have created USB and HID to assist in creating easy input methods for users. The issue with HID is that it is an innately trusted device for operating systems. While there is no issue with innately trusting a keyboard, there is a problem with trusting a device that can masquerade as a keyboard. In 2014 the power of devices known generically as BadUSBs was demonstrated at Defcon. These devices can pretend to be a keyboard and automatically input malicious commands upon plug in. The user is powerless to stop the USB after they plug the device into their machine since the takeover occurs in an incredibly short amount of time. This project seeks to create a small amount of required human interaction in the device handshake to mitigate the threat from a BadUSB.

This project can potentially save companies from headaches in the future. There is no current ethical issue with developing an application to assist in the protection of a computer, and while there are currently mitigations in place to protect against BadUSB attacks, this will introduce a full protection against it.

## Project Goals
1. Determine optimal programming language
2. Build prototype of BUCS
3. Test prototype of BUCS

These goals are the overall goals of the project. The specifics of how they will be accomplished are to be discussed later in this plan, but our project can be expressed in these four main goals. 

## Project Methodology
